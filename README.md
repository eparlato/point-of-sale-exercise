# WBITDD - Point-of-sale Exercise
My version of the Point-of-sale exercise from Worlds Best Introduction to TDD by J.B. Rainsberger.
It's an Eclipse project.

I used mock objects for tests, using the design-by-contract technique described in the video "Integrated tests are a Scam" by J.B. Rainsberger.
